<h1>The Pokemon Anime</h1>
<p>The Pokemon animated series has been running since Pokemons initial release in 1996 and has followed the generations from the game series with regions but keeps the main character off Ash Ketchum from Pallet town in Kanto. The series is known for Ash Ketchums never changing age and for its iconic characters from the earlier seasons when the anime was at it's peak popularity such as Brock and Misty who are gym leaders from <a href="Gen 1.html">Generation 1</a> but are more friends to Ash in this series. The Pokemon anime series is currently at 1025 episodes and is still going with the current season "Pokemon the series: sun & moon-Ultra Adventures" based off the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon games.</p>
<br>
<h2>Initial Release</h2>
<p>The Pokemon animated series released during the honeymoon period of pokemon when sales were booming and excitement for content produced about pokemon was high. For that reason the first episode of the Pokemon animated series released without issue and immediately received a large following thta keeps ratings high to this day with younger generations being able to reminisce on their own anime series that was released around the time that they were growing up and watching the pokemon anime series.</p>

<h2>New Generations</h2>
<p>The Pokemon animated series was very successful in changing the generation that there series was based in with new seasons coming out for each of the pokemon generations and a new reason for Ash to lose his pokemon and for his pikachu to lose its might when moving to a new region. The charcters were sometimes made up and lots of cities were made up for the regions as the games do not feature many cities and towns. The community is generally excited when a new season is released as the characters that are sometimes lifeless in the games are able to truly be brought too life and used as they like with personalities that cannot be truly captured in the video game series.</p>

<h2>Movies</h2>
<p>There are 21 movies based off the Pokemon animated series, most receive poor box office results and are seen as add ons rather than essential parts of the Pokemon animated series. These movies are seen as poor in all categories including plot, characters and dialogue but generally people can admit to enjoying the animation and visuals that come out off the movies. The first movie "Mewtwo strikes back" was released in 1999 and movis have been produced since up until the most recent movie "I choose you wich released in November of 2017."</p>
