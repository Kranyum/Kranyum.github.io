Kalos is alot more Urban than previous Generations prominantly featuring cities that accompinied with new 3D features makes for the largest region in the Pokemon Franchise. The architecture is also very different in this game with more European architecture taking place in the ciy and towns compared to the much more modern Japanese and American styles that were previously featured.
