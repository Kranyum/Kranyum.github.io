<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>The Pokemon Trading Card Game uses a turn based system to see who can achieve ultimate victory by knocking out all of the opponents active and bench Pokemon or preventing the opponent from drawing a card at the start of their turn. Only one pokemon can be active at any one time with five bench pokemon available for when your active pokemon is knocked out. You must wait one turn for evolution to occur and you may not evolve your active pokemon into an EX card or any other type of special card without having the base card out first. You may use one move per turn and use one ability card per turn. Damage types comply based off the card with type effectiveness displayed below the card that you are attacking being revevant. You may retreat any pokemon to the discard pile for the retreat cost that is displayed on the bottom of the card in energy cards which must also be used to do most damaging moves, to know how much and what type of energy you have to use you must consult the card and the icons that are nect to the move you are about to use.</p>
