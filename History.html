<h1>The History Of Pokemon</h1>
<p>The History of the Pokemon franchise starts just over two decades ago when production of the first game began. Satoshi  Tajiri who as a child found himself often catching incsects and tadpoles near his home in urban Tokyo decided that the only way to bring kids of the new generation that joy would be to make a game out of it calles Pocket monsters later shortened to pokemon for English and European releases. </p>
<br>
<h2>Conception</h2>
<p>The Company Gamefreak was formed by Tajiri and Ken Sugimori who after find out out about the gameboy and gameboy link cable he instantly had images of insects walking along the cable, Tajiri was also heavily influenced by Ultraman fantasy television in which ultraman used large monsters stored in small capsules to fight. These two things inspired him to pitch a project called Capsule monsters to Nintendo and it was denied, but one man Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda saw potential in it and working with Tajiri and Gamefreak they started developing Capsule monsters which would later due to copyright issues be named Pocket Monsters. </p>
<br>
<h2>The Company</h2>
<p>Gamefreak is a company made by 3 people Satoshi Tajiri, Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda with the ambition to create a game for the nintendo gameboy system, in the early days Gamefreak would make money by selling gaming magazines and making much smaller projects until they were financially secure enough to start making the game that the company had been created to make, Pokemon. After creating Pokemon Red and Blue Nintendo cought out the comapny Gamefreak and as a second party developer who would make games exclusively for their systems. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l8V_eQ6wGQ&ab_channel=GameInformer">Click here for a video on pokemon in its early stages of development up until some later generations.</a> </p>
<br>
<h2>Initial release</h2>
<p>Upon initial release in , Pokemon Red and Green as it was in Japan had modest sales but after news got out off a legendary pokemon that wasnt in the game got out sales started rocketing followed by a competition that would give this pokemon to twenty entrants and the release of Pokemon Blue in Japan, sales were at an all time high. It was around this time that the <a href="TCG.html">Pokemon Trading card Game</a> released which caused lots of excitement within the pokemon community that was quickly increasing in Japan. Due to the series success and how quickly it came, the pokemon series would also receive manga adaptations aswell as a <a href="Anime.html">Anime</a> adaptation that would follow a new character Ash on his adventure through the Kanto Region.</p>
<br>
<h2>International Release</h2>
<p>News spread quickly that there was a new gaming franchise growing in popularity all across Japan that had the American community wanting to see what the game was and why it was so popular. Gamefreak counting on this happening was already working on an English Translated version of the game, Before the game was able to releae in America however, Localization teams attempted to change the design of a few pokemon saying that cute wouldn't work in America but after Nintendo denied this appeal Pokemon Red and Blue released in North America on the 30th of September in 1998, 23 days after the Anime released with an English Dub which was already building lots of hype for the upcoming games which were given their new name Pokemon.</p>
<br>
<h2>New begginings</h2>
<p>It soon became apparent that the original 151 Pokemon would not last with new Pokemo being seen as early as episode one in the anime, so when Generation 2 was announced and released on November the 21st of 1999 in Japan there was lots f hype and games flew off the shelves with high sales Gamefreak was sure that what they had created was here to stay and now over 20 years later the Pokemon franchise is still going strong all because some random guy in Japan liked catching insects.</p>
